Trying to relearn how to use ASP.NET + C# as it's been a few years (last touched anything regarding this back in 2019)

## Why?

Friend advised me to try and learn as I'm still pushing for full stack development, so it will be a good way to learn + see if I'm able to get through this project solo

## What am I trying to accomplish with this?

- Being able to show that I can create a website using ASP.NET technologies
- Proving to myself that I needed to just put in extra time to learn back when I got thrown into the deep end without much assistance
- Also to add as another project to my portfolio
- And see if I'm still able to relearn something I wanted to forget back then.
